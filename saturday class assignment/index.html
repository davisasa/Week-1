        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to upgrade my skills in the IT field. Primarily, I would love to be an all-rounder in terms of the 
            available skills in IT but I would like to specialize in software engineering. Regardless of its seeming
            difficulty I am determined to make the most out of my opportunity at codetrain to be the best I can.
